\section{Introduction}
This lab handbook serves as a side-by-side reference manual for you to use in your laboratory sessions. Not all information is included here (we expect you do to some research of your own) but it is a good starting point. It also includes some additional information you may find useful as you use the Raspberry Pi.

This handbook covers a range of topics from installation, to networking, to some more advanced topics such as cross compilation. There are links to useful learning resources, as well as some quick reference guides for you to refer back to as you work through all your practicals.
