\section{Mini Projects}
The mini project is a chance for you to use what you have learnt in this course and test your problem solving skills.

The projects use everything learnt in the previous practicals - so here's hoping you paid attention and remembered!

All students need to do Mini Project A. Only CS students need to do Mini Project B.
