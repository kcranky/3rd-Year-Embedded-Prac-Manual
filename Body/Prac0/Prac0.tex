\section{Prac 0 - Setting up and Connecting to Your Pi}
The Raspberry Pi is a powerful computing platform. While it can be used as a lightweight computer, it's true strengths are found when it is used as an embedded system or edge processor.\footnote{The term “edge computing” has become popular nowadays to refer to methods of bringing the computing power and its memory and peripherals closer to the location where these are needed (you could say that edge computing is the antithesis of cloud computing).}

In order to set up your Pi as fast as possible, you need to install the required software (primarily everything required to get you running Raspbian on the Pi), create a subnet to which your local machine (PC) and the Raspberry Pi can connct, and enable SSH. Following Sections \ref{sec:Prereqs}, \ref{sec:Process}, \ref{sec:Connectivity-Ethernet}, \ref{sec:Connectivity-ChangeComputerIP} and \ref{sec:SSH} will guide you through this process.

It's also strongly suggested that  you acquaint yourself with the BASH shell. A guide is given in Section \ref{app:UsefulResources}.

There is another option for installation known as NOOBS. This is not used in this course as we'd like to get you to do a full install and configuration of an OS.
