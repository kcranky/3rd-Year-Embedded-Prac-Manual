\section{Prac 0 - Setting up and Connecting to Your Pi}
The Raspberry Pi is a powerful computing platform. While it can be used as a lightweight computer, it's true strengths are found when it is used as an embedded system or edge processor. 

In order to set up your Pi as fast as possible, you need to install the software, create a network which both your Pi and PC can connect to, and enable SSH. Following Sections \ref{sec:Prereqs}, \ref{sec:Process}, \ref{sec:Connectivity-Ethernet}, \ref{sec:Connectivity-ChangeComputerIP} and \ref{sec:SSH} will guide you through this process.

There is another option for installation known as NOOBS. This is not used in this course as we'd like to get you to do a full install and configuration of an OS.
