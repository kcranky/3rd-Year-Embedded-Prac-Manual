\section{Prac 2 - C and Python}
Prac 2 should serve as an introduction to C, and cross compilation. Can be used as a comparative analysis between C and Python to justify why C is used going forward. Could be useful to present as a "research task" and follow the scientific method (hypothesis, methodology, results and conclusion) as this will help prepare students for EEE4120F practicals.


Perhaps use a benchmark written by students which will help with the DAC prac (wavetables, multiplication and addition, etc)
