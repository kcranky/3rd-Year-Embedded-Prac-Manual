\section{Prac 3}
Prac 3 should serve as an introduction to C, and cross compilation. Can be used as a comparative analysis between C and python to justify why C is used going forward. Could be useful to present as a "research task" and follow the scientific method (hypothesis, methodology, results and conclusion).

Ideas include 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple - design and implementation of a benchmark (perhaps just iterating over a very large loop, or adding floats). Can have additional marks for using, say, java? Or including both Python 2 and 3 for comparisons?
    
    \item Advanced - Checking speed of GPIOs using an oscilloscope
\end{itemize}
