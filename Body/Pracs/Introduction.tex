\section*{Introduction}
Welcome to the practicals for EEE3096S. These instruction are applicable to all practicals so please take note.

All files submitted to Vula must be in the format Studnm\_pracnum.fileformat

All reports must be done in Latex. Marks will be deducted if they are not.

It is critical to do the pre-prac work. Tutors will not help you with questions with answers that would have been known had you done the pre-prac work. 

The practical handbook introduces the important tools, knowledge and skills you will need for these practicals. While references to more detailed information is given, students are encouraged to learn more about these topics using the internet and to take responsibility for their learning.
