\section{Prac 5 - ALU}
\label{sec:Prac5}
\subsection{Overview}
An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital building block which can perform a variety of arithmetic, logical and bit shift operations. It is the base building block of a central processing unit and operates on integer binary numbers. The unit has both data and control signals. A basic ALU has two parallel input data busses (A) and (B) and one parallel output data bus (Y). It also has a parallel bus (F) which takes in an opcode or binary value which selects a specific arithmetic, logical or shift operation to be performed by the ALU on the two inputs A and B, it may also have a status output bus S which gives more information about the previous operation.

\subsection{Pre-Practical Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logisim
    \item Latex
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design the ALU using logical building blocks. Explain each step in your report. (30) \footnote{This is not a technical report as the one expected in practical 2. However, each building blocks must be represented in a figure, the functionality and the role of each building block in the bigger system must be explained.}
    \item Simulate your design in Logisim. Clearly label all inputs, outputs etc. Export a jpeg of the circuit and include it in your report. (10)
    \item Marks will be deducted for incomplete or untidy reports.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Further Instructions}
You are required to design and implement a 2-bit wide ALU with a 3 bit opcode, as follows:
% Please add the following required packages to your document preamble:
